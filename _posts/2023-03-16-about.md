# About

Thank you for using [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown).

This tool can help you sync your Medium posts with your own Jekyll blog. It will automatically download your posts from Medium, convert them to Markdown, and upload them to your repository. 

If you find this tool helpful, please consider to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhgchgli).❤️

Powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

Also, if you would like to remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark located at the bottom of the page, you may do so. I don't mind.

# Troubleshooting
## My GitHub page keeps presenting a 404 error or doesn't update with the latest posts.
- Please make sure you have followed the setup steps above in order.
- Wait for all GitHub actions to finish, including the `Pages build and deployment` and `Automatic Build` actions, you can check the progress on the `Actions` tab.
- Make sure you have the correct settings selected in `Settings -> Pages`.

### Things to know
- **Every commit and post change will trigger the `Automatic Build` & `Pages build and deployment` action. Please wait for this action to finish before checking the final result.**
- You can create your own Markdown posts in the `_posts` directory by naming the file as `YYYY-MM-DD-POSTNAME` and recommend using lowercase file names.
- You can include images and other resources in the /assets directory.
