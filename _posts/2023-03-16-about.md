## Setup
1. Click the green button `Use this template` located above and select `Create a new repository`.
2. Enter respository name as the URL path you wish to use and select `public`, then click `Create repository from template`.
- respository name(URL path) **MUST** end with `.github.io`
3. Granted access to GitHub Actions, go to the `Settings` tab in your GitHub repository, select `Actions` -> `General`, and find the `Workflow permissions` section. Below that, select `Read and write permissions`, and click on `Save` to save the changes.

### First-time run

1. Please refer to the configuration information in the section below and make sure to specify your Medium username in the `_zmediumtomarkdown.yml` file.
2. Then, you can manually run the ZMediumToMarkdown GitHub action by going to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository, selecting the `ZMediumToMarkdown` action, clicking on the `Run workflow` button, and selecting the `main` branch.

3. Please **wait for the action to download, convert, and commit your posts to your repository (note that the first run may be slow)**.


4. After the `ZMediumToMarkdown` action has completed, another action called `Automatic Build` **will start automatically, you should also wait for this action to finish running**.

5. Go to the `Settings` section of your GitHub repository and select `Pages`, In the `Branch` field, select `gh-pages`, and leave `/(root)` selected as the default. Click `Save` and **wait for the `Pages build and deployment` action to finish**.

6. You will obtain the GitHub Pages URL (e.g. `https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/zhgchgli.github.io/`) based on Step 5 (Show in `Settings` -> `Pages`). After all actions have completed, you can go to the URL and view the result.

After all is done, you can visit your `xxx.github.io` page to check the results or use `bundle exec jekyll serve` in your terminal for local testing.🎉

*If you cannot find the `gh-pages` option in the `Branch` field on the `Settings` -> `Pages`, please make sure you have followed steps 1 to 4 carefully and that all actions have completed successfully.

*If you open the URL and notice that something is wrong, such as the web style being missing, please ensure that your configuration in the `_config.yml` file is correct. Alternatively, you can set the base_url to your repository name in that file.
